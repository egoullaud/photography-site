Photography site

The client had a SquareSpace siteand wanted a site with better design to showcase their work. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a 10-page responsive website featuring photo and video galleries(with a full screen view modal), an about me page, and contact page with a form. 

I elected to build this site without the use of Bootstrap 5 or React so I could solidfy my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though, I feel the site runs a bit slow and in the future upgrading it to React with the use of GraphQL(so the client can add photos to their galleries) would be ideal. Alternatively, I could build an account login for the client with a dashboard so they can modify the galleries independently. 

My main challenges were design related and some minor technical issues. 

For the design, I made a prototype pretty quickly and gave it to the client for review(version1). We figured out what they liked by noting what they did NOT like. The client was able to pinpoint what they wanted and sent me a number of "dream" sites and I went through and pulled apsects that worked well together (fonts, colors, form styles)  and I was able to restyle the website and ship the product the next day(version2).

In terms of the technicial challenges, I did a ton of research around modals, responsive modals, and different types of modals and was able to short list a few solutions to try. It took me much longer than anticipated, and I had to walk around the block a few times before I settled on a solution. I was hoping to allow the user to exit the modal by clicking outside the photos, but on the smaller screens the feature was not working, and the modal would fail to close. To solve, I added a close button in the top corner that would appear regardless of screen size and solved the issue. 

Other technical issues were related to hosting the website, as I usually host via github pages (which is an EXCELLENT way to review the site with a client, but the shipped product needed to be hosted elsewhere). I did a domain transfer, FTP file transfer, set up server hosting, and was surprised to learn a domain transfer could take up to 2 weeks. In the future, I would transfer the domain at the start of the project so we could ship and get it up and running as soon as possible.
